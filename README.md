for Uploading our project , we use Git bash command prompt 
First, we created a .gitignore file using the 'touch .gitignore' command, in which those files names are  mentioned  that do not need to be pushed to the repository.
Then, we used the 'init' command.
After that, we used 'add .' to stage all the changes.
Then, we used 'commit -m "initial commit"' to commit the changes with a commit message.
Next, we used 'git status' to check the status of the repository.
Finally, we used 'git push origin' to push our project to the repository.
after all , we created a README file , and edited it with our contributions .
for All collaborators contribution in it , I use pull request to open this file for all , then they can easily edit it .
